# ApolloCipher

NOTE: This cipher is currently for demostration ONLY!

Do NOT put this into any kind of production system!

ApolloCipher is a XOR-based symmetric-key blockcipher developed for use in places where standard encryption libraries may be disallowed.

It is typically a terrible idea to 'roll your own crypto', and this Cipher is no exception. 

Improvements will be made to defeat frequency analysis, among other Cryptographic vulnerabilities that are common to One-Time Pad (OTP) based Ciphers.
